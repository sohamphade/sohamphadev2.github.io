tagline: "How to design assistive AI agents that learn individual user preferences, find top recommended actions out of several options for their user, bid opportunistically on behalf of the user in competing markets, be aware of the changing market conditions, and learn efficiently from past interactions? In this project we study these and other similar compelling questions."

<!-- Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proved to be valuable in several market and business related tasks such as targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, process monitoring, logistics, optimizing merchandize, resource utilization, assess resource availability, anticipate customer demand, and product pricing.
Besides it has also been helful in fraud detection, customer service and support.
Machine Learning (ML) and Data Analytics (DA) tools have 

Different types of [market designs](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/susan-athey/economics-980-topics-market-design/) are used for various economic activities (i.e. input of resources, production process, and output of products-goods or services).
For example, auction markets are used by the auctioneer (often a governement) to procure goods or allocate natural resources,

Resource allocation ard market design are central to many economic activities. 
Although these have been studied for centuries the technological developments in the recent past have led to
newer possibilities necessitating us to revisit these problems from a modern perspective. In
particular, I am referring to the following breakaway technologies:
1. Digital revolution: It enhanced communications and computation technologies. The more
compute power the more you can process at any given node
2. Internet of Things → Enhanced monitoring and data gathering
3. Artificial Intelligence → Enhanced data processing, learning, agent assisting through
recommendation systems
4. Markets + AI → Interactive solutions for multi-agent systems to enhance decision making and
resource allocation in multi-sided  markets.-->
